# Jutsu

## About

Jutsu is a Naruto-themed programming language created by Sid Ijju. Work on the language began on September 13th, 2022. The language is written from scratch (planned features include a tokenizer, parser, interpreter, and compiler).

### Evaluation

Jutsu was designed for fun, and fun only. While it is designed as a compiled language, it is compiled with Python since speed is not a concern. Jutsu does also have an interpreter that was written for debugging purposes.
