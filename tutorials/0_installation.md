# Setting up your environment

Currently these steps work only on OSX

1. Open a terminal and navigate to where you want to view Jutsu.
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/sidijju/Jutsu.git`. 
3. Move into the Jutsu directory.
4. Run `make`. If you get a _command not found_ error, you may need to install make. Additionally, correct installation errors if they occur (e.g. Python or Pyinstaller)

You should now be able to use the command 'jutsu' in your terminal
to run .ju files. You can also run a 'jutsu' execution environment by not passing a .ju file.
